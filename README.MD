# 🧴 Cosmetics Health Risk Prediction 🧪

This project uses machine learning to predict **health risk scores** of cosmetic products based on numerical data such as skin type, age group, product cost, and user ratings.

---

## 📌 Brief Explanation

This is a binary classification problem where the model predicts a health risk category (e.g., safe or risky) for cosmetic products. The project utilizes **Logistic Regression** for prediction and includes data cleaning, EDA (exploratory data analysis), model training, evaluation, and prediction using user input.
